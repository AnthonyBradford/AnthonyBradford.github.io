4 Learning GNU Texinfo
**********************

4.1 GNU Texinfo web resources
=============================

You will have to learn a little GNU Texinfo.  See the GNU Texinfo Manual
(http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/) and the GNU
Texinfo Reference Card
(http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/trunk/doc/refcard/txirefcard.pdf?root=texinfo&content-type=text%2Fplain).
Don't be alarmed at the size of the GNU Texinfo Manual.  Few Texinfo
commands are needed to have great looking multi-format content.

4.2 Basic changes
=================

Inside the directory 'texinfopublisher-1.1/' you will see a file
'Website.texi'.  This is the source file that is compiled when the
command 'make' is run.  The result of the compilation is the building of
your content.  Change your working directory to 'texinfopublisher-1.1/'
and type
     make
You have compiled a basic template with examples.  The 'Makefile' is
verbose and will give instructions to view the resulting output formats.


Using your favorite editor ('vi', 'emacs', 'gedit', 'kate', 'notepad')
edit
     texinfopublisher-1.1/Website.texi
Trying adding simple text to any of the nodes/sections and running
'make' to re-compile from the command line.  View the resulting output
to confirm the changes.

4.3 GNU Texinfo commands
========================

4.3.1 @node
-----------

Create new nodes (chapters) with the @node command followed with a
@chapter command.  All nodes names must also be declared between the
@menu and @end menu section of the .texi file.

Based on all the references to "Chapter 9" in
'texinfopublisher-1.1/Website.texi' think of what modifications would
have to be made to the file to create a "Chapter 10".

Try creating a "Chapter 10".  Try creating a chapter named
"Information".

4.3.2 @section / @subsection / @subsubsection
---------------------------------------------

Content between @node commands such as text between "@node Chapter 1"
and "@node Chapter 2" in 'texinfopublisher-1.1/Website.texi' can be
broken down into sections, subsections and subsubsections.

Try adding text content to sections / subsections and subsubsections.
Try adding more sections.  Add text like the following
     @section Another section example

4.3.3 @
-------

The at sign @ is a special character that starts all Texinfo commands.
To generated an at sign @ character in Texinfo two @@ characters must be
entered in the source .texi file.  The email address

anthony_bradford@@yahoo.com in a .texi file.

The { and } characters also have to be preceded with an at sign @.  Use
@{ to generate { and @} to generate }.
