2 Downloading Texinfo Publisher
*******************************

Texinfo Publisher works with the GNU / Linux operating system and
Windows / Cygwin environments.

2.1 Downloading
===============

Texinfo Publisher can be downloaded as a gzipped tar from
texinfopublisher-1.1.tar.gz
(http://anthonybradford.github.io/texinfopublisher/texinfopublisher-1.1.tar.gz)
or sourceforge.net
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/texinfo-web-publisher/?source=directory).

2.2 Configuring
===============

After downloading type the following commands

     tar xfz texinfopublisher-1.1.tar.gz
     cd texinfopublisher-1.1
     ./configure
The configure shell script will give system specific instructions on
package installation depending on your system.  This is not a autotools
package.

2.3 Configuration issues
========================

Texinfo Publisher will work with recent versions of 'texi2any'.
Texi2any (GNU texinfo) 5.2 or greater is recommended.  To find out which
version of 'texi2any' your system is running type
     texi2any --version
If your system is running a older version you can install the latest
version.  *Note Texi2any Installation: installtexi2any, for installation
instructions.

See 'README.testing' in the tar package for information on systems
Texinfo Publisher has been tested on.
