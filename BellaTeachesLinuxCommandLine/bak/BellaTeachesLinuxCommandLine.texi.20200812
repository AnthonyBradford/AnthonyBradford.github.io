@*
A input box saying ``Type To Search'' box will appear.
@*
@*
@center @image{images/TypeToSearch,12cm,2.5cm,Type To Search box,png}
@*
@*
Inside the ``Type To Search'' input box type the word ``terminal''.
@*
@*
@center @image{images/TypeToSearchTerminal,12cm,3.5cm,Terminal typed into Type to Search box,png}
@*
@*
The Linux terminal icon will appear. Select the terminal icon by clicking the left mouse button. The terminal is also known as the Linux Shell or the command line.

Congratulations! You have logged into Linux and opened a terminal on the desktop! The Linux Terminal is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from your input. In the next chapter we will execute some commands.

@node Linux Commands
@chapter Linux Commands
@cindex Linux Commands
@center @image{images/Bella-5,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@section @command{whoami}
@cindex whoami
The command @command{whoami} prints your userid. At the Linux terminal type the command: @command{whoami}.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/command-whoami,13cm,2cm,Example of Linux command whoami,png}
@image{images/whoami,,37pt,Example of Linux command whoami,png}
@*
@*
Linux responds that ``bella'' is the userid. Your system should respond with your userid.

@section @command{pwd}
@cindex pwd
The command @command{pwd} is used to print the name of current working directory.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/commamd=pwd,11cm,1.75cm,Example of Linux command pwd,png}
@image{images/pwd,,38pt,Example of Linux command pwd,png}
@*
@*
Bella's current working directory is ``/home/bella''. Therefore the ``bella'' directory is
inside the ``home'' directory. The first slash character ``/'' in the ``/home/bella'' directory name is know as the root directory.
The ``home'' directory is subdirectory of ``root''. The ``bella'' directory is a subdirectory of ``home''.

@section @command{ls}
@cindex ls
The command @command{ls} lists directory contents. Directories can also be called folders. At the Linux terminal type the command @command{ls}.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/command-ls,15cm,2cm,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@image{images/ls,,37pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
We see Bella has the following directories:
@*
Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, Templates, Videos.
@*
@*
We can look inside an individual directory by giving command @command{ls} a specific
directory name to look in. Type the command @command{ls Music}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-Music,,47pt,Example of Linux command ls on Music directory,png}
@*
@*
Looks like Bella has no music.
@*
@*
We can check if Bella has any documents. Type the command: @command{ls Documents}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-Music-Documents,,56pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
Bella has no documents.
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-4,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Use the command @command{ls} to explore the Linux filesystem. Type the command: @command{ls /}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-root,,73pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
This lists the contents of the ``/'' which is know as root.
@*
Type the command: @command{ls /home}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-home,,41pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}

@section @command{cd}
@cindex cd
The command @command{cd} changes your current working directory.
@*
At the Linux terminal type the command: @command{cd Music}.
@*
@*
Now the current working directory has changed to the Music directory.
@*
@*
The command @command{ls} will display the contents of the ``Music'' directory.
@*
@*
@image{images/cd-Music-ls,,39pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
The ``Music'' is empty.
@*
@*
The command @command{pwd} will display the full directory path.
@*
@*
@image{images/cd-Music-ls-pwd,,58pt,Example of Linux command ls on Documents directory,png}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-6,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
To pop up from the ``Music'' directory type the command: @command{cd ..}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/cd-dot-dot,,70pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Now the current working directory is one level above. To confirm this type the command: @command{ls}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/cd-dot-dot-ls,,84pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}

@section @command{mkdir} and @command{rmdir}
@cindex mkdir
@cindex rmdir
When using the command @command{ls} we can see that Bella has the following folders in
her ``/home/bella'' directory.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/command-ls,15cm,2cm,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@image{images/ls,,37pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
To create a directory named ``Test'' type the command: @command{mkdir Test}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-mkdir-Test,,45pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Try typing the command @command{ls} to confirm this directory was created.
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-mkdir-Test-ls,,77pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
To remove the directory named ``Test'' type the command: @command{rmdir Test}
@*
@*
@image{images/ls-mkdir-Test-ls-rmdir-Test,,85pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Type the command @command{ls} to confirm that the directory ``Test'' has been removed.
@*
@*
@c @image{images/command-ls,15cm,2cm,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@image{images/ls-mkdir-Test-ls-rmdir-Test-ls,,103pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-8,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}

@section @command{echo} and @command{cat}
@cindex echo
@cindex cat
The command @command{echo} is used to write text to the screen. The command @command{echo} can also write text to a file. At the Linux terminal type the command: @command{echo}.
@*
@*
@image{images/echo,,37pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
The command @command{echo} with no arguments will just display a blank line.
@*
Now try typing the command: @command{echo Hello}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-echo-Hello,,56pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
The text ``Hello'' will be displayed to the terminal. The command @command{echo} can also push text to a file.
@*
@*
Try the command: @command{echo "This is a test" > file.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-echo-Hello-echo-file,,70pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
The command @command{echo} has placed the text ``This is a test'' inside the @file{file.txt}.
@*
@*
We can confirm the file exists with the command @command{ls}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-echo-Hello-echo-file-ls,,100pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Notice the file @file{file.txt}. The contents of the file @file{file.txt} can be displayed with the command: @command{cat file.txt}. The command @command{cat} can concatenate files and print on the display. The contents of the file is the text ``This is a test''.
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-echo-Hello-echo-file-ls-cat,,120pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-9,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}

@section @command{cp} and @command{rm}
@cindex cp
@cindex rm
The command @command{cp} copies files and directories. The command @command{rm} removes files or directories.
@*
Create a file with Try the command: @command{echo "This is another test file" > TestFile.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-Test-File,,26pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Confirm the file exists with the command @command{ls} and confirm the file contents with the command @command{cat}.
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-Test-File-cat,,77pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Using the command @command{rm} delete the file with: @command{rm TestFile.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-Test-File-cat-rm,,85pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
Now confirm the file was deleted with the command @command{ls}
@*
@*
@image{images/echo-Test-File-cat-rm-ls,,98pt,Example of Linux command ls,png}
@*
@*
@center @image{images/Bella-11,,180pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Using the command @command{echo} lets create another file @file{NewTestFile.txt}.
@*
Type the command: @command{echo "Test file to be copied" > NewTestFile.txt}
@*
@*
Confirm the file exists with the command @command{ls}. Confirm the contents with the command @command{cat}.
@*
@*
@center @image{images/cp-1,,70pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Copy the file @file{NewTestFile.txt} to the file @file{1.txt} with the command: @command{cp NewTestFile.txt 1.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-2,,77pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Copy the file @file{NewTestFile.txt} to the file @file{2.txt} with the command: @command{cp NewTestFile.txt 2.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-3,,80pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Copy the file @file{NewTestFile.txt} to the file @file{3.txt} with the command: @command{cp NewTestFile.txt 3.txt}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-4,,95pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Confirm the existance of the new files @file{1.txt}, @file{2.txt} and @file{3.txt} with the command: @command{ls}
@*
@*
@image{images/cp-5,,130pt,Picture of Bella,jpg}
@*
@*
Concatenate the files @file{1.txt}, @file{2.txt} and @file{3.txt} to be diplayed on the screen with the command: @command{cat 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt}
